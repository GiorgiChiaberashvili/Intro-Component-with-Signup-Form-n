## My process

Never giving up and keep pushing further

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Block
- Javascript
- and with bunch of Love.

### What I learned

Keep increasing my project difficulties to practice more and more HTML / CSS and adding Javascript functionalities in the following project I learned:

HTML Basics: Learned how to create proper Submission Form with First/Last/Email and Password Forms.

Hardest part was to properly set up text and iccon to show up in form.

As well learned that best practice is to keep each input in seperate div for best styling purposes.

Minor new HTML basics:

Label tags -  good practice for accesibility so must be included.

Input text relocation - using text-indent

Minor CSS basics:

Using Parent styling to keep code clean and easily readable.  

Javascript: Improving my Javascript code understanding managed to correct form inputs values and style through basic Javascript
